We highly recommend integrating Swimm into your development workflow. This way, you can gradually cover all the important aspects and parts of your codebase, without needing to allocate significant time and resources. You can also keep your existing content constantly fresh.

### Creating units while you work
If you’ve recently committed something that should be documented, you can create a unit directly from the commit. 
When creating a unit, click here and enter the relevant commit’s SHA:

</br></br></br>
Your commit will be loaded as a series of code snippets. Erase irrelevant snippets, move them around and add comments to complete your unit.

Integrating Swimm into your CI:
If you want to keep your units up-to-date as the code changes, you can integrate Swimm into your CI, to see what units are outdated or can be automatically synced, by using the swimm verify command. Please read this doc for more information.

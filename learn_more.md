Swimm helps you to organize your content and find it in several ways.
</br></br>

### Playlists

Playlists, like the one you are in now, are step by step flows of Docs, Exercises, README files, Videos and/or Links that can give you a structured approach on how to explore the repo.

### The Tree View

Checkout the folder tree on the left of your repo view:

</br></br></br>
Most docs have code snippets in them. We use this to map them on your repoâ€™s folder and file structure. Greyed out folders and files do not have related documentation. The ones that are clickable, do. You can click on a folder or a file to see which docs relate to it.

</br></br></br>

### Plans

Playlists can only link to docs that relate to a specific repository. If your team is using multiple repositories, you can create Plans on your Workspace. Use Plans to link to docs or playlists across several repositories. You can also create different Plans for different teams and/or different onboarding processes. Another use for a Plan is to join a few Playlists together, one after the other.

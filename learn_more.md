Swimm helps you to organize your content and find it in several ways.
</br></br>

### Playlists
Playlists, like the one you are in now, are step by step flows of Docs, Exercises, README files, Videos and/or Links that can give you a structured approach on how to explore the repo.

### The Tree View
Checkout the folder tree on the left of your repo view. Most docs have code snippets in them. We use this to map them on your repoâ€™s folder and file structure. Greyed out folders and files do not have related documentation. The ones that are clickable, do. You can click on a folder or a file to see which docs relate to it.


Swimm helps you to organize your content and find it in several ways.
</br></br>

### Playlists
Playlists, like the one you are in now, are step by step flows of Units, ReadMe files, Videos and/or Links that can give you a structured approach on how to explore the repo.

### The Tree View
Checkout the folder tree on the left of your repo view:

</br></br></br>
Most units have code snippets in them. We use this to map them on your repoâ€™s folder and file structure. Greyed out folders and files do not have related units. The ones that are not, do. You can click on a folder or a file to see which units relate to it.

</br></br></br>
### Plans
Playlists can only link to units that relate to a specific repository. If your team is using multiple repositories, you can create Plans on your Workspace. Use Plans to link to units or playlists across several repositories. You can also create different Plans for different teams and/or different onboarding processes.

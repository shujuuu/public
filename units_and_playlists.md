###Units and Playlists are where the action happens. 

Highly coupled with the code, Units are tutorials that walk you through different areas, help you checkout patterns or recurring issues for example, using commands in your CLI.
</br></br>

Playlists - like this one that you are in - are step by step flows of Units, ReadMe files, Videos and/or Links that can give you a structured approach on how to explore the repo.

Make sure you always have the latest version of your repository pulled as well as make or merge PR's after creating Units or Playlists.

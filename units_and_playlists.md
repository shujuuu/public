# Docs
Docs are tutorials that are highly coupled with the code and demonstrate important concepts of your repository structure and logic. They can contain markdown-formatted text, images, links to other document and most important of all, selectable code snippets. As your code changes, any docs that incorporate code snippets will stay in sync.
</br></br>

Let's look at what content you can include in Swimm Docs!

## Code Snippets
Use snippets to illustrate the parts of the code that you need to document; Your readers will see with a visual checkmark that the snippet they're looking at is up-to-date or outdated. More on the status on the next Doc.
</br></br>

## Smart Text
Smart texts are often used on top of code snippets. Once you included a snippet, you can reference `any-tokens` inside ‚Äî function, variable, class name ‚Äî and turn them into smart symbols too. Swimm will track them instead of treating them as normal text.
</br></br>

## File Paths
Paths is another smart symbol you can include in the Doc. When a path is changed, Swimm will be able to tracked them and notify you.
</br></br>

## Existing Doc
You can also mention another existing Doc you created within your workspace. This points the reader to the right place to read more about another subject matter. One small trick is to put existing doc on top of each other to present them as an ordered playlist. 
</br></br>

## Images
Uploaded images could be saved to your codebase as well. You can turn this setting on in the integration page.

Now that you know what you can add to a Doc, start writing your documentation with this suggestion:
- üîé Recurring patterns and how to approach this
- üéØ Common Topics everyone on the team should know
- ‚öõÔ∏è Architecture and data flow within application

The starting point of creating a Unit is to think on parts of your code that demonstrate important concepts of your repo’s structure and logic, and then break those into tangible exercises. 

Below you can find 3 different approaches to define your Unit topic used by Swimmers:

# 🔎  Identify recurring patterns

Recognize one recurring pattern and explain how you would approach it.

## Example

"Our system recognizes new devices on the network - So, every time we support a new device, we create a class for it, which inherits from Device."

# 🎯  Display Common Topics 

Map the the topics everyone on the team should know and write a Unit for each topic.

## Example

Modules / libraries: Which ones should every person joining your team know?

# ⛏️  The First-Task Approach

Map what the first task should look like and what is important to know before starting.

## Example

The onboardee’s task is adding a new UI component for a Text Button.

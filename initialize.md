Once you enter a new workspace, you will be prompted with the options to add a new repo or to add/install the required ones from your Workspace.
</br></br>
To create, utilize and access all the interactive Swimm content and tutorials (Docs, Exercises, Playlists) on the repos, you need to have them cloned locally to your machine.
</br></br>
Note that you also have the option to use CLI instead of GUI. To do so, `cd` to the repo's folder in your terminal and use the command `swimm start` or 'swimm install' with the git host clone path.

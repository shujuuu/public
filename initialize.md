Once you start Swimm for the first time, you will be prompted with the options to To either join an existing repository (‘join’) or start a new one (‘initialize’).

To create, utilize and access all the interactive Swimm content and tutorials (called Units and Playlists) on the repos, you need to have them cloned locally to your machine. Another way to initialize a repo is by doing that in your terminal instead of in the UI. To do so, cd to the repo folder in your terminal and use the command swimm start.

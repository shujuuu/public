Congrats! You are actually playing a Unit as you read this sentence. 



&nbsp;

To demonstrate how this works with Code, letâ€™s look at some screenshots from an example of a public repo by Swimm - Python Best Practices. 

Let's look at an example from the first Unit on Data Structures:

To play a Unit from the repo: 


&nbsp;

   **1.** Click anywhere on the grey box starting with `swimm play` - and this command will be copied to your clipboard.
   
&nbsp;
   
   **2.** Paste that command to your terminal, where your current directory is that of the repository. At that point, you will get a few notes:

   **3.** When you `swimm play` - the Unit is activated in a different branch called swimm. All your operations while playing the Unit will happen in this branch.
   
&nbsp;
   
   **4.** On the next step we'll get to know common commands used in Swimm's CLI.

>ðŸ’¡ Bonus: You can install Swimmâ€™s public playlist - Python Best Practices, by using the following command from your terminal: 
>`swimm install https://github.com/swimmio/python_best_practices.git` and follow along.

Swimm units and docs are saved on your repository in a directory named swm as .swm files. </br> They are shared and synced with the rest of the team the same way that code is, using Git. 
</br> </br> 
.swm files are readable. Open the one that corresponds to the unit you created to see how itâ€™s built.
